# Investigate AlphaVault contract

Source: https://github.com/charmfinance/alpha-vaults-contracts/blob/main/contracts/AlphaVault.sol

## Ideal high-level API

At the highest level, the `AlphaVault` contract exposes the following functions:

Deposit:

```solidity
function deposit(
    uint256 amount0Desired,
    uint256 amount1Desired,
    uint256 amount0Min,
    uint256 amount1Min,
    address to
)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    returns (
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1
    ) {

    }
```

Withdraw:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 shares,
    uint256 amount0Min,
    uint256 amount1Min,
    address to
) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {

}
```

Get total amounts:

```solidity
function getTotalAmounts() public view override returns (uint256 total0, uint256 total1) {

}
```

This could be represented by the following types:

```typescript
type DepositArgs = {
  amount0Desired: number;
  amount1Desired: number;
  amount0Min: number;
  amount1Min: number;
  to: string;
};

type DepositResult = {
  shares: number;
  amount0: number;
  amount1: number;
};

type WithdrawArgs = {
  shares: number;
  amount0Min: number;
  amount1Min: number;
  to: string;
};

type WithdrawResult = {
  amount0: number;
  amount1: number;
};

type GetTotalAmountsResult = {
  amount0: number;
  amount1: number;
};
```

Methods using these types could be encapsulated in a class as follows:

```typescript
class AlphaVault {

  constructor() {

  }

  async deposit(depositArgs: DepositArgs): Promise<DepositResult> {

  }

  async withdraw(withdrawArgs: WithdrawArgs): Promise<WithdrawResult> {

  }

  async getTotalAmounts(): Promise<GetTotalAmountsResult> {

  }

}
```

This would allow it to be used like so:

```typescript
import { AlphaVault } from 'alphavault-sdk';

const alphaVault = new AlphaVault();

const { shares, amount0, amount1 } = await alphaVault.deposit({

});
```

## Connecting to deployed contract

Communication can be handled via JSON-RPC using the `ethers` package:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Look at packages/provider-helpers/src/ProviderFactory.ts
ethersProvider = ethers.getDefaultProvider(networkToUse);
```

According to https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#Contract--creating, a contract's methods can be invoked as follows:

```typescript
this.contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, this.provider);
const [amount0, amount1] = await this.contract.functions.getTotalAmounts();
```
